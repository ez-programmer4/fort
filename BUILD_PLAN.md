## Phase 0 — Project Setup & Infrastructure

- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL 16 (+ volume, healthcheck)
- [x] Scaffold `backend/` — Express, Prisma, env config, error middleware
- [x] Scaffold `frontend/` — Next.js + Tailwind (layout shell arrives with login in Phase 1)
- [x] Verify: DB up, backend `/health` responds, frontend renders

## Phase 1 — Auth, Users & Roles (§3.4)

- [x] Prisma models: `User`, `Role`, `Permission`, `RolePermission`
- [x] Seed 4 roles: Admin, Accountant, Operations, Sales (+ default admin user)
- [x] Auth endpoints: login, refresh, me (JWT, bcrypt; logout is client-side token discard)
- [x] RBAC middleware (permission-per-endpoint)
- [x] User CRUD endpoints (Admin only)
- [x] Frontend: login page, auth context, protected routes
- [x] Frontend: Users page (list/add/edit/deactivate)
- [x] Frontend: Roles & Permissions page (view/edit permissions per role)

## Phase 2 — Locations & Suppliers (§3.3, part of §3.7)

- [x] Prisma models: `Location` (name, type: Retail/Warehouse/Dispensary, address, contact person)
- [x] Prisma models: `Supplier` (name, TIN, phone, email, address, bank accounts)
- [x] CRUD APIs for both
- [x] Frontend: Locations page, Suppliers page (list, search, add/edit forms)

## Phase 3 — Product Management (§3.5)

- [x] Prisma models: `Product` (type, pharmacotherapeutic class, generic name,
      brand, description, strength/dose, dose unit, route, dose form, order unit,
      dispense unit, conversion factor, country, manufacturer, supplier link, unit price, code)
- [x] Lookup lists: dose forms, routes, units (seeded, editable)
- [x] Product CRUD API with filter/search/pagination
- [x] Excel: download template, export products (filters + batch selection), bulk upload with validation
- [x] Frontend: Products page (table + filters), Add/Edit Product form, Import/Export UI
- [x] Bin Card (pulled forward from Phase 4): `Batch` + `StockMovement` tables, report API, printable page

## Phase 4 — Inventory & Stock (§3.6)

- [x] Prisma models: `Batch` (product, batch no., expiry, supplier, unit cost),
      `StockMovement` (type, direction, qty, reason, performed by, date, location) — done early in Phase 3
- [x] `Stock` table (batch × location current quantity) kept in sync by a shared stock service
- [x] Inventory view API: code, generic, brand, description, qty, price, supplier, batch, expiry — per location
- [x] Stock adjustment API (increase/decrease + reason) → writes `StockMovement`
- [x] Bin Card report API: product + location + date range → In/Out/Balance rows (done in Phase 3)
- [x] Frontend: Inventory page (filter/search/export), Stock Adjustment form
- [x] Frontend: Bin Card page + printable output (done in Phase 3)

## Phase 5 — Procurement / GRV (§3.7)

- [x] Prisma models: `PurchaseOrder`, `PurchaseOrderItem`, `GoodsReceipt` (GRV), `GRVItem`
- [x] Create PO: pick products (search/filter), qty, price
- [x] GRV: receive against PO → enter qty, batch, expiry, price, location → creates batches + stock-in movements
- [x] Optional withholding tax on purchases (goods vs services)
- [x] Non-sale item purchases (office supplies etc. — `ExpensePurchase`)
- [x] GRV history API + page
- [x] Frontend: PO creation flow, GRV receiving flow, GRV history

## Phase 6 — Sales & Dispensing (§3.8)

- [x] Prisma models: `DispenseOrder`, `DispenseItem` (batch-level), `Attachment`
- [x] Dispense flow: select location → product → batch → qty → per-sale price adjustment
- [x] Dispense summary (editable quantities) → confirm → stock-out movements
- [x] Print dispense slip (browser print-to-PDF; branded PDF in Phase 9)
- [x] Sales history with attachments upload
- [x] Frontend: Dispense page (cart-style), summary/confirm, slip print, history page

## Phase 7 — Wallet / Finance (§3.9)

- [x] `Payment` model (cash/credit lives on `DispenseOrder` since Phase 6; WHT fields already there)
- [x] Outstanding balances (credit sales) API
- [x] Record payment endpoint (overpay guard, credit-only)
- [x] Withholding tax handling on sales (done in Phase 6, surfaced in wallet summary)
- [x] Frontend: Wallet page — summary cards, outstanding credits, record payment, payment history

## Phase 8 — Alerts & Dashboard (§3.1, §3.2)

- [x] Alerts engine: expiring/expired, low stock, over stock, stock adjustments —
      **thresholds per product in its own dispense unit** (minStock/maxStock/expiryAlertDays on Product)
- [x] Alert detail: reason, movement type, performed by, date, qty, expiry, batch no.
- [x] Frontend: Alerts page (filter by type + location, count cards)
- [x] Dashboard API: stock overview, low-stock/expiring counts, sales summary, top movers
- [x] Frontend: Dashboard with quick links to POs, Dispensing, Reports

## Phase 9 — Reports (§3.10)

- [x] Finance report: total sales, COGS, gross profit, revenue, payments — filter by location + date range
- [x] Sales report: performance by period, date-wise revenue
- [x] Professional PDF layout: logo + signature block (pdfkit, shared `utils/pdf.js`)
- [x] Frontend: Reports page with filters + on-screen preview + PDF download
- [x] Alerts page reworked to tabs (Expiring / Expired / Low / Over / Adjustments) with count badges

## Phase 10 — Settings & Polish (§3.11, §4)

- [x] Settings: pharmacy name/logo initials, WHT default rates, default expiry alert window
      (wired into PDFs, dispense slip, alerts engine and WHT form defaults)
- [x] Responsive pass (sidebar auto-collapses on tablet-width screens; tables scroll)
- [x] Audit trail review page (all stock movements with filters)
- [x] Security hardening: rate limiting (login + general), validation throughout, helmet
- [x] Final end-to-end walkthrough (all 17 pages verified, live data flows checked)

**All 11 phases complete — the system fulfils every module in requirnment.md.**

# Adjustment & Enhancement Phases (v1.1)

Source of truth: [adjustment_requirnment.md](adjustment_requirnment.md) (2026-07-16).
Items marked **➕ (added)** are professional-UX additions beyond the spec, per user request.

## Phase A1 — Shared UI Component Library (§1 foundations)

Build once, reuse everywhere (all monochrome, keyboard-accessible):

- [x] **Drawer** — smooth slide-in panel from the right for all Add/Edit forms (§1.2)
- [x] **Pagination** footer — rows per page 10 (default) / 25 / 50 / 100 + page controls (§1.1)
- [x] **SearchInput** — debounced 350 ms, fires only from 2+ characters, clear button (§1.3)
- [x] **DatePicker** — custom calendar popover, single date + range mode (§1.4)
- [x] **Combobox** — searchable select for large lists (type-to-filter, arrow keys) (§2.3)
- [x] **LoadingScreen / Spinner / SkeletonRows** — branded, used app-wide (§1.6)
- [x] ➕ **Toast notifications** — success/error feedback instead of inline banners only
- [x] ➕ **ConfirmDialog** — for destructive actions (cancel PO, deactivate, dispose)
- [x] ➕ **EmptyState** — consistent friendly empty tables with a call-to-action
- [x] Navbar/sidebar toggle (§1.5 — already built in Phase 2; icons-only collapse + persisted state)
- [x] Pilot integrations: Locations page (drawer, pagination, search, toasts, confirm, skeleton,
      empty state) and Bin Card (product combobox + date-range picker)

## Phase A2 — Roll-out Across All Modules (§1 applied)

- [x] Pagination on every table: products, inventory, users, locations, suppliers,
      procurement (3 tabs), sales history, wallet (credits + payments), audit trail
- [x] All Add/Edit forms become Drawers: users, locations, suppliers, products,
      stock adjustment, new PO, receive GRV, expense, record payment
- [x] Debounced 2+ char search everywhere a search box exists
- [x] Combobox for supplier & product selection: product form, PO lines, dispense
      stock picker, bin card product select (§2.3)
- [x] Custom DatePicker replaces native date inputs: bin card, wallet, reports,
      audit, PO receive expiry, sales history
- [x] ➕ Branded loading + skeleton rows during data fetch on all pages

## Phase A3 — Alerts Module Adjustments (§2.1)

- [x] **Dispose** action on expired / near-expiry alerts → new `DISPOSE` stock-out
      movement (reason required, permission-gated), clears the alert as stock leaves
- [x] Search + filter inside the alerts list (product search, location, type tabs stay)
- [x] **Clickable product details** — product drawer from any alert: product info,
      current stock by batch/location, recent movements
- [x] ➕ Dispose confirmation with quantity preview (ConfirmDialog)
- [x] ➕ Clickable summary cards per alert type (counts, icon, color) that double as tab filters
- [x] ➕ Alerts sorted by urgency server-side (soonest expiry / biggest deficit-excess / most recent first)
- [x] ➕ Disposals show up in the Adjustments tab and Audit Trail (`DISPOSE` movement type, labeled)
- [x] ➕ Manual Refresh control (alerts are computed live, not cached)

## Phase A4 — Dashboard Enhancements (§2.2)

- [x] **Customer entity** (required for Top Customers — not in v1.0): optional
      customer (name/phone) captured at dispensing via Combobox with quick-create
- [x] **Profits Overview** — Gross Profit + Net Profit/Loss (gross − expenses),
      trend indicators ↑/↓ with % vs previous period
- [x] **Top Customers** — ranked by sales volume & frequency, last order date
- [x] **Charts** (line/area/bar, monochrome palette):
  - Sales vs Purchases trend
  - Gross & Net Profit trends
  - Top products by margin · Top products by volume
  - Monthly performance overview
- [x] ➕ Period selector for the dashboard (7d / 30d / 90d / 12m)
- [x] ➕ Reusable `Combobox` quick-create (`onCreate`) — generic addition, not just for customers
- [x] ➕ Hand-built SVG chart components (`TrendChart`, `RankBars`) validated against the
      dataviz skill's color/contrast checks — no new chart-library dependency

## Phase A5 — Sales Print + Final Polish (§2.4)

- [x] **Printable Sales History** — professional print layout with date-range picker
- [x] ➕ Sales history date-range filter on screen (not just for print)
- [x] ➕ Final consistency sweep: spacing, typography, focus states, tablet check
- [x] Verify everything end-to-end, update HISTORY.md

---

**All adjustment phases (A1–A5) complete — the professional UX pass is done.**

---

## Phase A6 — Post-launch Punch List

Follow-up items reported after using the finished app.

- [x] Sidebar collapse toggle moved from the top navbar into the sidebar itself
      (bottom of the rail, with a chevron that flips on collapse)
- [x] Sidebar made `sticky` + full viewport height so it (and the header) stay in
      place while only the main content scrolls; collapsed state now shows
      hover tooltips for each nav icon; user profile + sign-out moved into a
      sidebar footer
- [x] Fixed DatePicker/Combobox popovers rendering clipped or mispositioned
      inside Drawers and horizontally-scrolled tables (e.g. procurement's
      expiry-date picker) — both now portal to `document.body` and position
      with `fixed` coordinates computed from the trigger's bounding rect, so
      no ancestor `overflow` can clip them; flips upward automatically when
      there's no room below
- [x] Column sorting added to every paginated table (Locations, Suppliers,
      Users, Products, Inventory, Procurement's 3 tabs, Sales History,
      Wallet's 2 tabs, Audit Trail) — click a column header to sort, click
      again to reverse; server-side via `?sortBy&sortDir` so it works
      correctly together with pagination, with a whitelist per endpoint so
      an invalid `sortBy` can never reach the database

## Phase A7 — Public Homepage

The public-facing company is **Fort Pharma PLC** (the registered business,
per its Google Maps listing), which imports pharmaceuticals from around the
world and distributes them across Ethiopia; **FortInventory** is its
internal inventory platform (mentioned on the homepage as the tech behind
the operation, and still the name/branding of the staff login portal). Root
`/` previously just redirected straight to `/login`; it now shows a public
marketing homepage to signed-out visitors, and still redirects signed-in
users straight to `/dashboard`.

- [x] `frontend/src/components/marketing/homepage.tsx` — sticky navbar
      (mobile menu), hero, country-sourcing marquee ticker, animated
      count-up stats, "what we import" services grid, 4-step process,
      why-us section, CTA banner, contact (info cards + real embedded
      Google Map + "Get directions" + mailto-based form), footer with a
      "Client Portal" link to `/login` — all major sections fade/slide in
      on scroll via a small `useReveal` IntersectionObserver hook
- [x] `frontend/src/components/marketing/globe-map.tsx` — hand-built SVG
      hero graphic: a wireframe globe with pulsing origin markers (China,
      India, Germany, UAE) and animated dashed flight paths (with a moving
      dot per path via native SVG `<animateMotion>`) arcing across to
      Ethiopia's **real national outline** (extracted once from `world-atlas`
      TopoJSON boundary data via a throwaway script, simplified to 90 points,
      then hardcoded — no map library ships to the browser) with a pulsing
      Addis Ababa pin at its real coordinates — CSS keyframes (`dash-flow`,
      `pulse-ring` in `globals.css`)
- [x] Real product categories in the services grid — Medication, Equipment,
      Cosmetics (replacing an earlier, invented six-category list) — each
      with a few example-product tags
- [x] `frontend/src/components/marketing/hooks.ts` — `useReveal` (scroll
      reveal) and `useCountUp` (eased count-up, starts once the stat
      scrolls into view)
- [x] Real Google Maps embed (`output=embed`, no API key) + "Get
      directions" link, both pointed at Fort Pharma PLC's actual
      coordinates (9.0572416, 38.7138769) from the Google Maps listing the
      user provided
- [x] `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` renders `<Homepage />` for guests instead
      of redirecting to `/login`; still redirects authenticated users to
      `/dashboard`
- [x] Added marketing icon set (globe, mail, phone, check, arrowRight,
      clock, x, star, beaker, heart, snowflake) to `components/icons.tsx`
- [x] Self-hosted Inter font via `next/font/google`, wired as `font-sans`
      through a Tailwind v4 `@theme` block
- [x] Verified: `tsc --noEmit` clean; `/` and `/login` both return 200; SSR
      output for the homepage checked directly (temporarily bypassed the
      client-side auth gate) to confirm all sections — including the new
      globe/map graphic and ticker — render with no runtime errors

**Note:** contact details (address, phone, email) and stats (countries,
years in operation, etc.) in `homepage.tsx` are placeholders — replace with
the company's real figures before this goes live.

---

## Build Order Rationale

Auth first because every other module needs users/permissions. Locations,
suppliers and products are master data that inventory depends on. Stock and
movements (Phase 4) are the core — procurement writes stock **in**, dispensing
writes stock **out**, and alerts/reports/dashboard just read what those wrote.
